<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="updated">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <p>ManYue respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All your data stays on your device.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>ManYue ("the App") is a comic reading application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the App. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our practices.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
<p>ManYue does not operate any backend servers. We do not collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
  <li>Location data</li>
  <li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data</li>
  <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
  <li>Browsing history or reading habits</li>
  <li>Contact lists or photos</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Information Stored Locally</h2>
<p>The following information is stored only on your device (or your personal iCloud account if enabled) and is never transmitted to us:</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Data</th><th>Purpose</th><th>Storage</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Reading preferences</td><td>App settings and customization</td><td>Local device</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Favorites and bookmarks</td><td>User's comic collection management</td><td>Local device</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Download cache</td><td>Offline reading</td><td>Local device</td></tr>
  <tr><td>First install time</td><td>Genesis Membership eligibility</td><td>Keychain (iOS) / EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Subscription status</td><td>Feature access control</td><td>Keychain (iOS) / EncryptedSharedPreferences (Android)</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>4. iCloud Sync</h2>
<p>If you are a ManYue Pro or higher member, you may enable iCloud Sync. When enabled, your reading data and preferences are synced through your personal Apple iCloud account. This data is governed by Apple's iCloud terms and privacy policy. ManYue does not have access to your iCloud account or its contents.</p>

<h2>5. WebDAV and Cloud Storage</h2>
<p>ManYue Pro and higher members can connect to personal WebDAV servers, SMB shares, and cloud storage services. Connection credentials and data are stored locally on your device. ManYue communicates directly between your device and your personal server — no data passes through any intermediary server operated by us.</p>

<h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>ManYue offers subscription plans and a lifetime purchase option. All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive, process, or store any payment information such as credit card numbers or billing addresses.</p>

<p>Purchase verification is performed locally on your device using Apple's StoreKit framework and App Store receipts. No purchase data is sent to any external server.</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>ManYue connects to third-party comic source websites as configured by the user. These connections are made directly from your device. Each third-party website has its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review them. ManYue is not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party comic sources.</p>

<h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>ManYue does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal data from any user, no special measures are required. However, parents and guardians should supervise their children's use of the App and the content they access.</p>

<h2>9. Data Security</h2>
<p>Sensitive data such as subscription status and install time is stored using platform-native secure storage mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Keychain Services with first-unlock accessibility and optional iCloud Keychain sync.</li>
  <li><strong>Android:</strong> EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by Android Keystore.</li>
</ul>
<p>These mechanisms provide hardware-backed encryption on supported devices.</p>

<h2>10. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data (except Keychain items on iOS, which persist for subscription restoration purposes).</li>
  <li>You can clear cached data at any time through the App's settings.</li>
  <li>Keychain data on iOS can be removed by resetting the device or using Apple's Keychain management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
<p>Since ManYue does not collect or store any personal data on external servers, there is no personal data for us to access, correct, delete, or port. All your data is under your full control on your own device.</p>

<h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
